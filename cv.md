## About me
Creating websites has fascinated me since my childhood. My goal now is to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to start a successful career as a web developer.
One of my strengths is my persistence in acquiring new knowledge. I am confident that the skills I have acquired while obtaining a PhD in Material Science will help me on my path to becoming a programmer.
## My Skills
* GIT, GitHub
* VS Code
* Adobe Photoshop
* Figma
* HTML5
* CSS3, SCSS/SASS
* JavaScript
* Gulp
## Code Examples
**Task description**:

*You must create a function, spread, that takes a function and a list of arguments to be applied to that function. You must make this function return the result of calling the given function/lambda with the given arguments.*

**My solution:**

```
function spread(func, args) {
  return func(...args);
}
```
